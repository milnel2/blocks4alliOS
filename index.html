                   <li>Select Add Robots (in the center, near the bottom of the screen).</li>
                   <li>A new screen will open with a list of robots. Select your robot’s name (it will appear near the top of the screen). Once she connects, her name will turn green. If you have VoiceOver on, it will say “connected.”</li> 
                   <li>Press the Workspace button in the upper left corner of the screen. This will open up the coding environment where you can send commands to the robot. On the left side of the screen is the toolbox, which contains a menu of all the commands (called blocks) that you can send to the robot. In the center of the screen is the main workspace.</li>
                   <li>Find the Drive category in the toolbox and select it. </li><li>A new toolbox screen will open with your drive options! Select the first block in this screen (it is called Drive Forward).</li>
                   <li>Once selected, your choice will appear in the toolbox.</li>
                   <li>Select anywhere in the workspace and the Drive Forward block will be placed at the beginning of your code. You do not need to drag and drop!</li>
                   <li>Dash is ready to drive! Press the Play button (green triangle) in the bottom right corner of the screen.</li>

                   <li>Did you notice that the Drive Forward and Drive Backward blocks have another block on top of them? These are called modifier blocks and we can use them to help Dash drive farther.</li>
                   <li>Select the modifier block on top of Drive Forward (it says 30 cm, Normal).</li>
                   <li>A new screen will appear with your options. At the top of the screen is a distance slider. Let’s use it to help Dash drive 50 centimeters. </li>

                   <li>Optional: You can also change how fast Dash drives! Select the Faster (plus) and Slower (minus) buttons to make her go the speed you want.</li>

                   <li>We can help Dash repeat her dance by using a loop. We can create one by selecting the Control category in the toolbox.</li>
                   <li>Select the first block in this category (Repeat) and place it anywhere in the workspace.</li>
                   <li>In the workspace, Repeat has two blocks that are next to each other (you may have to scroll left or right to find both). The one on the left is Repeat and the one on the right is End Repeat. We can put the commands we want to repeat in between these two blocks (inside the loop).</li>
                   <li>Since we want Dash to repeat her whole dance, we will have to move all three other blocks into the Repeat loop. We can start with Drive Forward.</li>
                   <li>Select Drive Forward in the workspace (you may have to scroll left or right to find it). Make sure to select the bottom block and not the modifier. Once you select it, the block is ready to be moved.</li>
                   <li>Select End Repeat to put it inside the loop.</li> 
                   <li>Repeat this move for Nod and Drive Backward. Now Dash’s whole dance should be inside Repeat.</li>

                           <li>Dash sings! (Hint: Check out the Sounds category. You can change the noises with the modifier block.)</li></ul>
